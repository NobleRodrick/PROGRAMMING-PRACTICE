## Dealing with algorithms in Python programming language

# An algorithm can be defined as the current term of choice for a problem solving procedure.. It is commonly used nowadays for the set of rules of a machine(... especially a computer) follows to achieve a particular goal

# A search algorithm for example, is a procedure that determines what kind of information is retrieved from a large mass of data

# An encryption algorithm is a set of rules by which information or messages are encoded so that unauthorized persons cannot read them.

## We will be covering the following in this part of the noble repository

# Simple Recursive Algorithms
# Algorithms with data structures
# Divide and conquer
# Greedy algorithms
# Dynamic Programming
